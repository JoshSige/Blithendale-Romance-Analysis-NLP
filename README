# Blithedale Romance Analysis
Joel Reske

##Overview
This was a project that I did for a class at Tufts, COMP150-06 Natural Language
Processing. It analyses Blithedale_Romance.txt and creates a tagged
Blithedale_Romance_Tagged.xml file for future parsing. Also I did some extra
work beyond what the assignment asked for and built an engine to create
Blithedale_Romance_Stats.txt which does some nifty word counts and creates
character arcs for the important proper nouns in the book.

##Instructions
To run, simply use `python < main.py` with Blithedale_Romance.txt in the same
folder.

##Other
Also included is the assignment instructions (this is a one-off class so it
should be fine that it's up) in Lab1.pdf
